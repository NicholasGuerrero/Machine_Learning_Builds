# Machine_Learning_Builds
This is Nicholas Guerrero's depository for different types of machine learning algorithms. For "Build" files the mathematics behind the algorithms are built from scratch.

The different types of algorithms are as follows:

1: Linear Regression:
  OLS_Files = [linearregression_Tutorial.py,  linearregression_Build.py]
  
2: K Nearest Neighbors
  KNN_Files = [K_Nearest_Neighbors_Tutorial.py, KNeighbors_Build.py,  KNeighbors_compare.py, ]
  
3: Support Vector Machine
  SVM_Files = [SVM_Tutorial.py,  SVM_Build2.py]
  
4: K Means & K Mean Shift
  K_Means&Shift_Files = [linearregression_Tutorial.py,  KMeans_Build.py, Mean_Shift_Tutorial.py, Mean_Shift_Build.py]

5: Handling Non_Numeric Data
  File = [Handling_Non-Numeric_data2.py]
  
6: Clustering
   Clustering_File = [Clustering_Tutorial.py]

7: Deep Learning
   Deep_Learning = [Deep_Learning_Tutorial.py]
   
8: Data Sets
   Data_Set_Files = [breast-cancer-wisconsin.data.txt, titanic.xls]
